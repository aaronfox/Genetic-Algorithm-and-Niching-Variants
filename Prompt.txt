1. Find existing code or make your own implementation of the GA

2. Try on benchmark functions M1 and M4 (see advanced EC lecture slides), also defined in Section 7 of the paper (see link below):

     Mahfoud - M1 - M2 - M5 - etc-A Comparison of Parallel and Sequential Niching Methods.pdf

3. Repeat this time, trying to maintain diversity, i.e.

Modify GA using at least 2 different niching methods

4. Plot fitness statistics Fmax, Favg, and Fmin versus generation #

5. Vary crossover and mutation rates: Pm,Pc 

6. Repeat experiments 10 times and report averages

7. Plot initial + final population over the landscape of the function (as shown in lecture slides) for the best experiment with each method.

8. Report should be well structured like a paper with Intro of Problem Statement, Overview and Pseudocde of Algorithms, Experimental Protocol and Analysis of Results and Conclusions, etc (for sample formats: see attached paper as well as the paper:



Comparison of Multi-Modal Optimization Algorithms Based on Evolutionary Algorithms

IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:

If you prefer to use matlab, here is source code for most of the mini-project:
